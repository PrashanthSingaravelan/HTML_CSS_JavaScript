	<h2>Apple Silicon</h2>
	<p>
		The Apple M1 is the first ARM-based System on a Chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. for its line of Macintosh computers.It appears in the fourth-generation MacBook Air, fifth-generation Mac Mini, and the 13-inch fifth-generation MacBook Pro.It is the first personal computer chip built using a 5 nm process. Apple states that it has the world's fastest central processing unit (CPU) core "in low power silicon" and the world's best CPU performance per watt.

	<h2>CPU and GPU cores</h2>
	<p>
		The M1 has four high-performance and four low-power (dubbed "e-cores" or "high-efficiency") cores, providing a configuration similar to ARM big.LITTLE. This combination allows power-use optimizations not possible with Appleâ€“Intel architecture devices. Apple claims the low-power cores use one-tenth the power of the high-performance ones. The high-performance cores have 192 kB of instruction cache and 128 kB of data cache and share a 12 MB L2 cache; the low-power ones: 128 kB instruction cache, 64 kB data cache, and a shared 4 MB L2 cache.
